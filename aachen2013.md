#### Background

Since the beginning of the multicore era, parallel processing has
become prevalent across the board. However, in order to continue a
performance increase according to Moore's Law, a next step needs to be
taken: away from common multicores towards innovative many-core
architectures. Such systems, equipped with a significant higher amount
of cores per chip than multicores, pose challenges in both hardware
and software design. On the hardware side, complex on-chip networks,
scratchpads and memory interfaces as well as cache-hierarchies,
cache-coherence strategies and the building of coherency domains have
to be taken into account.

However, the ROME workshop focuses on the software side because
without complying system software, runtime and operating system
support, all these new hardware facilities cannot be exploited. Hence,
the new challenges in hardware/software co-design are to step beyond
traditional approaches and to wage new programming models and OS
designs in order to exploit the theoretically available performance as
effectively as possible.

#### Topics

The focus of this workshop stands in the tradition of a successful
series of events hosted by the Many-core Applications Research
Community (MARC). Although this workshop is not considered as a
self-contained MARC symposium, the organizers and several members of
the tentative program committee are part of the MARC community.
Authors from all related disciplines are invited to submit unpublished
papers regarding software for novel many-core hardware architectures.

* Operating system support for novel many-core architectures
* Many-core aware runtime support for large-scale applications
* Virtualization solutions to deal with hardware limitations
* Tools for performance analysis on many-core systems
* Dealing with legacy software on novel many-core architectures
* New approaches for leveraging on-die messaging facilities
* Experiences porting, running, or developing applications
* Traditional and new programming models for novel many-core
  hardware
* Bare-metal programming and system software
* Power-aware many-core computing

#### Program

The workshop takes place in the room *Super C - Generali* on Monday,
August 26, 2013. It is scheduled as full-day workshop. A detail
location plan is published in the [program
booklet](http://www.europar2013.org/program-booklet-now-online.html).
