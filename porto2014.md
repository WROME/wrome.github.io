#### Background

Since the beginning of the multicore era, parallel processing has
become prevalent across the board. However, in order to continue a
performance increase according to Moore's Law, a next step needs to be
taken: away from common multicores towards innovative many-core
architectures. Such systems, equipped with a significant higher amount
of cores per chip than multicores, pose challenges in both hardware
and software design. On the hardware side, complex on-chip networks,
scratchpads and memory interfaces as well as cache-hierarchies,
cache-coherence strategies and the building of coherency domains have
to be taken into account.

However, the ROME workshop focuses on the software side because
without complying system software, runtime and operating system
support, all these new hardware facilities cannot be exploited. Hence,
the new challenges in hardware/software co-design are to step beyond
traditional approaches and to wage new programming models and OS
designs in order to exploit the theoretically available performance as
effectively and power-aware as possible.

The focus of the ROME workshop stands in the tradition of a successful
series of events originally hosted by the Many-core Applications
Research Community (MARC). Prior MARC Symposia took place at ONERA
research center in Toulouse, at the Hasso Plattner Institute in
Potsdam and at the RWTH Aachen University. Last year, this successful
series has been continued by the 1st ROME workshop at the Euro-Par
2013 conference as a thematically related follow-up event for a
broader audience.

#### Topics

This year, too, authors from all related disciplines are invited to
submit unpublished papers regarding software for novel many-core
hardware architectures. The call for papers especially emphasizes on
the challenges and research questions arising from the upcoming
generation of heterogeneous and/or massive parallel systems stepping
towards a many-core dominated exascale era. The topics of interest
include, but are not limited to:

* Operating system support for novel many-core architectures
* Software stacks for new concepts of compute acceleration
* Many-core aware runtime support for large-scale applications
* Virtualization solutions to deal with hardware limitations
* Tools for performance analysis on many-core systems
* Dealing with legacy software on novel many-core architectures
* New approaches for leveraging on-die messaging facilities
* Experiences porting, running, or developing applications
* Traditional and new programming models for novel many-core hardware
* Heterogeneity- and/or hierarchy-aware many-core middleware
* Bare-metal programming and system software
* Power-aware many-core computing

#### Program

The workshop takes place in the *room 5* on Tuesday, August 26, 2014.

#### Paper Submission, Registration, and Publication

Workshop papers must not exceed **twelve** single-spaced,
single-column pages ([LNCS style](ftp://ftp.springer.de/pub/tex/latex/llncs/latex2e/llncs2e.zip)).
On acceptance of the submission, at least one author is required to
register for workshop attendance at Euro-Par 2014 and present the
paper in the workshop session.

Upload your submission to our [submission server](http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=europar2014ws) in
PDF format. It must not be simultaneously submitted to the main
conference or any other publication outlet.

For the workshop, we will prepare hand-outs with the accepted papers.
The revised versions will be published after the conference in the
workshop proceedings of Euro-Par 2014, part of the LNCS series of
Springer.
